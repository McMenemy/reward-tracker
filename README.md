# reward-tracker

Just a script that I wrote for myself that gives allows me to store enjoyable relaxing activities and enjoyable tasks 
in csv files and then randomly choose from them. Basically, its so I actually mix up my free time activities and don't just
always play league of legends to relax -_-. There is also a study that shows that randomimizing rewards entices people more.
